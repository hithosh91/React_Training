1.why react js?
react js is a javascript Library 
component based architecture-- resuablity and maintainable to easier to debug
virtual dom --faster rendering --update only where the parts are changed
Unidirectional Data flow: 

2.What is UseState?
state is away to store and manage information in component that can change over time

it is a hook provided by react to enable state in functional component


3.What is hoisting?
variable and fucntion   declarations are moved to the top of their scoped during compiled phasee
  variabel:
  console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 5

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
The declaration let y is hoisted, but it's in a "temporal dead zone" until the actual declaration is encountered, leading to a ReferenceError.

4.use Strict
secure code , human error / It prevents the use of undeclared variables, disallows duplicate parameter names,  dont reffer window object

"use strict"

let x=10;    x=10
console.log(x)

5. difference between  === && ==

== is compare the value
=== is compare value and data type

6.what is difference between let var and const?

var is functional scope and it has hoisting
where as let is block level scope
const is block level scoep and while declare it must be instiallised

7. event loop?
it is a single threaded ,non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language  means handle multiple operation at the same time despite have single threaded
call stack--synchronous  code--tract function call , when functionis called added to stack when its is completed it is removed from the stack


web api: asynchronous operation --example setTimeout

callback queue --whe an asynchronous operation is completed its callback function is added to callback quess

console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 2000);

console.log('End');
